# Python 12-Hour Free Course (Bro Code, 2024) 💻🤔

This repository contains example programs and practice exercises from the "Python 12-Hour Free Course" by Bro Code (YouTube, 2024). The code is organized into folders for games, practice programs, and programming concept examples.

## Repository structure 📋

- `games/` — small game projects (e.g., hangman, rock paper scissors, slot machine, quiz)
- `practice_programs/` — short practice scripts and utilities (e.g., calculators, converters)
- `programming_concepts/` — example files demonstrating Python concepts (classes, loops, list comprehensions, etc.)

Each file is a small, self-contained script designed for learning and experimentation.
